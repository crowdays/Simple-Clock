Name: Command-line Clock in Ruby
Date: 3/3/23
Creator: Lorenzo Juarez

Description:
This is a simple program written in Ruby that displays a clock in the terminal and prompts the user for input. It uses a loop to continuously update the clock and wait for user input.

Challenges Faced:
The main challenge faced while writing this program was to create a loop that would continuously update the clock while also waiting for user input.

Future Improvements:
In the future, the program could be improved by adding more commands that the user can enter, such as setting the time or changing the clock format.

How to Use:
To use the program, simply run it in the terminal. The clock will be displayed along with a prompt for user input. Enter "help" to see a list of available commands or "close" to exit the program.
